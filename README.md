# DoughMother Bakery Site

A self-initiated project for university, documenting the design and development of a wesbite for DoughMother bakery in Beeston. I plan to use html, scss, and a bit of javascript for the first time. I also want to explore using bootstrap as a way to make the site responsive.

## Reflection

A university project, I wanted to find a local business and see if I could code them a website to increase their internet presence.

I wanted to build a site that was on brand and felt like an extension of their already existing company.

The biggest challenge I faced during this project was making it responsive. It was the first time I'd done this.
