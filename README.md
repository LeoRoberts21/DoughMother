# DoughMother
Building a website for DoughMother, a bakery in Beeston, Nottingham.

A self-initiated project for university, documenting the design and development of a wesbite for DoughMother bakery in Beeston. I plan to use html, scss, and a bit of javascript for the first time. I also want to explore using bootstrap as a way to make the site responsive.

Code is in 'new' branch.
